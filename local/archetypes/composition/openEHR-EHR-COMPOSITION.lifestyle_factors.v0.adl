The scope of this record can includes, but is not limited to: an overview of smoking and tobacco use; alcohol consumption; substance use; gambling; physical activity; diet and nutrition; and sexual health.

This archetype is usually managed as a persistent list, however there are situations where the list may be used within episodic care and require additional attributes such as context etc to enable accurate recording. The openEHR reference model currently only allows context to be recorded within Event-based COMPOSITION archetypes. As a result, this archetype has been modelled as an Event, rather than Persistent, COMPOSITION, to allow for flexibility so that some clinical systems can safely manage Lifestyle Factors for episodes of care, while others will choose to implement this COMPOSITION to act in a persistent manner.

Initial design of this archetype was funded by the iCareNet Antenatal Shared Care Plan project, Northern Territory, Australia. (en)">
