The intent of this archetype is only to hold the media file and the metadata describing its capture. This archetype will be nested within another archetype, usually an OBSERVATION or ACTION that will hold the context and circumstances related to the capture of the media file. For example, details about the modality, view or aspect of a radiographic image and DICOM details will be captured within the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result archetype. 

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- A photo of an injury;
- A diagram of the location of a specific clinical finding;
- A radiological image;
- An audio or video recording of an interview;
- Scanned pathology slide;
- Data output from a clinical device, such as an ECG machine; or
- A scanned image of paper documentation or hand-written clinical notes.

The 'Content' data element allows for the media file to be captured and stored within the health record using the Multimedia data type. The Multimedia data type has many RM attributes such as the size of file and URI to an external source. See https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html#_dv_multimedia_class.

If more than one media file has been captured, such as 'before' and 'after' images of a wound, use a separate instance of this archetype to represent each media file.

If a series of media files is represented as a single item, such as a CT scan, one instance of this archetype can be used to represent a URI path to the group. (en)">
