In practice, the design intent is for the CLUSTER.imaging_exam family of archetypes to be used to record all detailed findings on radiological examination. The family of specialised archetypes are derived from this generic parent archetype, CLUSTER.imaging_exam, designed as a universal pattern for recording any findings in any specified body structure or region and using any modality.

Each structure- or region-specific specialisation of this parent archetype is intended to be inclusive of all reasonably anticipated and relevant findings. For example: CLUSTER.imaging_exam-ovary will support recording of all findings that would be expected in reporting on imaging of the ovary using any radiological modality, including the size of the ovary, largest follicle size and the diameter and description of specific follicles. Similarly, CLUSTER.imaging_exam-lymph_node_group will contain data elements required to record specific findings of a lymph node group, including its precise or relative location in the body and the number of lymph nodes in the group. 

If an appropriate specialisation is not available for a body structure or region, this generic archetype can be used to record all relevant findings related to the structure or region. 

If an additional significant, but unanticipated or unexpected, finding needs to be recorded within the context of one of the CLUSTER.imaging_finding family of specialisations but there is no relevant data element available to record it, use the generic CLUSTER.imaging_finding archetype nested within the 'Additional details' SLOT to capture the additional information - one instance per finding.

This archetype and its related family of specialisations are designed to be nested within the 'Structured imaging findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.imaging_exam_result or within other relevant CLUSTER.imaging_exam archetypes, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. If they need to be extended with further levels of detailed findings, additional instances of the CLUSTER.imaging_exam, its specialisations, or CLUSTER.imaging_finding archetypes can be nested in the 'Additional details' SLOT.
