			purpose = <"The Six Minute Walk Test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity.">
			use = <"The 6MWT can be used in patients of any age group with a wide range of diagnoses. It assesses the functional capacity of the individual and provides valuable information about all systems during physical activity, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, blood circulation, neuromuscular units, body metabolism, and peripheral circulation, and is designed to be completed with additional measurements during the test.">
			keywords = <"6MWT", "six minutes", "walking", "test", "aerobic capacity", "endurance", "walk test", "cardiopulmonary", "cardio">
			misuse = <"Absolute contraindications for the 6MWT include the following: unstable angina during the previous month and myocardial infarction during the previous month. 

Relative contraindications include a resting heart rate of more than 120, a systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure of more than 100 mm Hg. Patients with any of these findings should be referred to the physician ordering or supervising the test for individual clinical assessment and a decision about the conduct of the test. 
The results from a resting electrocardiogram done during the previous 6 months should also be reviewed before testing. Stable exertional angina is not an absolute contraindication for a 6MWT, but patients with these symptoms should perform the test after using their antiangina medication, and rescue nitrate medication should be readily available.">
