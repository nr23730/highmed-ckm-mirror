Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:
--- Have you ever had an appendectomy? Yes, No, Unkown.
--- Have you done a hip or knee replacement in the past twelve months? Yes, No, Unkown.
- Specific questioning before admission to a hospital.	

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific questionnaire. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the 'text' choice to match each specific use case.

In use cases where it's important to differentiate the time context of a question in the persisted data, the reference model EVENT structure can be used to record this difference. For questions specifically about the point in time of recording, use a point in time EVENT, for example \"Have you ever had an appendectomy?\". In contrast, for questions specifically about a period of time, use the interval event, for example, \"Have you done a hip or knee replacement in the past twelve months?\".

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening process identifies a completed procedure and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the procedure (such as the date of procedure) should be recorded using the ACTION.procedure archetype.
