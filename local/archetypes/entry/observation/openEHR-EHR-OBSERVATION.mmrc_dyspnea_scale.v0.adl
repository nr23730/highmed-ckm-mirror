			purpose = <"To record the expression of dyspnea the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale is a simple and valid method. It can be used to categorize patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of their disability.">
			use = <"Used to record the characterisation baseline dyspnea in patients with respiratory disease such as COPD. Whilst it moderately correlates with other healthcare-associated morbidity, mortality and quality of life scales (particularly in COPD) the scores are only variably associated with patients' perceptions of respiratory symptom burden. It is used as a component of the BODE Index, which predicts adverse outcomes, including mortality and risk of hospitalisation. The scale is easy and efficient to use.">
